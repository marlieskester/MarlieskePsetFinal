Application allows users to search for songs and add them to a personal list.
Data flow:
Keyword entered in main, using Asynctask and HTTPmanager data is retrieved using the keyword. 
This will be displayed in foundsongsactivity using resultListAdapter, which includes an onclick listener.
This listener opens another activity with information on the song, a button to get extra informatiion and a button to add or remove from list.
This final activity has not been tested yet, and will be improved the following days.
Signup and login drafts are added, but not yet used in the application itself.
