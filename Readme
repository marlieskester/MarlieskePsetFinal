Application allows users to search for songs and add them to a personal list.
Data flow:
Keyword entered in main, using Asynctask and HTTPmanager data is retrieved using the keyword. 
This will be displayed in foundsongsactivity using resultListAdapter, which includes an onclick listener.
This listener opens another activity with information on the song, (a button to get extra information) and a button to add or remove from list.
"Add" will be shown when the screen is accesed through browsing or get-top-tracks, while when accessed from playlist it will beset to "delete".

Extra option: Get top so-many songs. 

Would have done:
Since my listview handles the onclick function, no finish() is called, so the back navigation is not too wonderful.
Firebase database rules are set on public, because for some reason this was the only way to get data to the database.
Preferably, this would have been set to "private".
There is one function I couldn't get to work, but I left it in the project because I think I was pretty close. I
It would be connected to a button so that the user would be able to get more information on the song by going to a webpage.

Overall, I am happy with the result. I have edited the layout to match last-FM, and I have tried to style my code according to the reference.
